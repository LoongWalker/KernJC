    media: v4l: async: Fix duplicated list deletion


    The list deletion call dropped here is already called from the

    helper function in the line before. Having a second list_del()

    call results in either a warning (with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y):


    list_del corruption, c46c8198->next is LIST_POISON1 (00000100)


    If CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is disabled the operation results in a

    kernel error due to NULL pointer dereference.'
