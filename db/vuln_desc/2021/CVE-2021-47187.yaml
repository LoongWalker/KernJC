    arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Fix CPU/L2 idle state latency and residency


    The entry/exit latency and minimum residency in state for the idle

    states of MSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the

    timings were written for CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param

    was miscalculated (supposedly, while porting this from downstream);

    Then, the power collapse states are setting PC on both the CPU

    cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have different timings: in the

    specific case of L2 the times are higher so these ones should be

    taken into account instead of the CPU ones.


    This parameter misconfiguration was not giving particular issues

    because on MSM8998 there was no CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2

    power collapse was rarely (if ever) hit.

    When CPU scaling is enabled, though, the wrong timings will produce

    SoC unstability shown to the user as random, apparently error-less,

    sudden reboots and/or lockups.


    This set of parameters are stabilizing the SoC when CPU scaling is

    ON and when power collapse is frequently hit.'
