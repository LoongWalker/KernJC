    clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding


    Currently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device''s MMIO region, while

    leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause

    a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix

    this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,

    and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.


    This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses the

    correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.


    Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited error

    handling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting

    is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.'
