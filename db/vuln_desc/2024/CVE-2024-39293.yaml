    Revert "xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem"


    This reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.


    This patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances

    redirect to the same AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is

    possible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,

    which will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when

    flushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked list of

    sockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix

    is not possible, so let us revert this for now.'
