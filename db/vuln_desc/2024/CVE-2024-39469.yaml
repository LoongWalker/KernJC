    nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors


    The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read

    fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the

    folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely

    determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.


    In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a

    failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop

    with I/O if i_size of the directory''s inode is also corrupted, causing the

    log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.


    Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false

    value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.'
